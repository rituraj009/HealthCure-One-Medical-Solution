# HealthCure-One-Medical-Solution

## Project Introduction

Welcome to our AI-powered disease detection system! This project aims to revolutionize patient care by leveraging advanced technology for the accurate and rapid detection of seven critical diseases. Our system harnesses the power of machine learning to provide quick and reliable diagnoses, ultimately enhancing patient monitoring and treatment.

## Project Goals
1) Develop an end-to-end solution for disease detection, encompassing data input, processing, and accurate diagnosis.
2) Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image-based disease detection, and classical machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost) for other forms of input.
3) Offer a user-friendly web-based interface to facilitate seamless interaction and easy access to the system's capabilities.
